# AT2_UnsecurePWA
This is an assessment task submission for the Secure Software Architecture topic of the HSC Software Engineering course.
The task involves re-engineering a Progressive Web App (PWA) to improve its security by effectively and efficiently patching **THREE** vulnerabilities.
The original PWA **(unsecure)** can be found here: https://github.com/TempeHS/The_Unsecure_PWA
## Installation Guide
The files can be cloned as a ZIP folder from this repository.
Extract the folder and open the folder in a new window in **Visual Studio Code**.
In the search bar of VS Code, enter "> Python: Create Environment" and select the Venv option. Use an appropriate Python interpreter path.
Install the flask library by initialising a terminal (CTRL + `), then entering "pip install flask".
## Usage Guide
Open the main.py file and initialise the program. Then click on one of the given links in the terminal. *(for example: http://127.0.0.1:5000)*
### **While the PWA has been re-engineered to improve security, there are still significant flaws. Do NOT enter any personal information.** [!WARNING]
